There's a Youtube channel I've been watching quite a bit of, and recently he posted a video about [doubting himself as a creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cil6RoFlKHg) and I started thinking about what effect that might have on myself as a dev.

In particular, I think there's a tendency, at least in my own mind, to equate all doubt as something that I should just ignore.
