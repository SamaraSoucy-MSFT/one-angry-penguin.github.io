title:  "Is Doubting Yourself a Good Thing?"

There's a Youtube channel I've been watching quite a bit of, and recently he posted a video about [doubting himself as a creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cil6RoFlKHg) and I started thinking about what effect that might have on myself as a dev.

In particular, I think there's a tendency, at least in my own mind, to equate all doubt as something that I should just ignore. A lot of it comes from good 'ole [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome#:~:text=Impostor%20syndrome%20(also%20known%20as,exposed%20as%20a%20%22fraud%22.), which is generally not useful. Does that really mean I should ignore all my doubts about myself or do they actually serve some useful purpose?
